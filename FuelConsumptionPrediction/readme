This project is part of the evalution of the Data Science Specialization, in the Developing Data Product Couses.

Basic Algorithm
=================
This ShinyApp is very simple.
1st. We use the 'mtcars' dataset to create a regression model considering the variable "mpg" as the outcome and the variables "cyl", "am", "hp", "gear", "wt" as predictors. 

2nd. We use the user inputed value (in the panel) to create a new dataset that will be used for prediction.

3rd. We use the "predict" function to predict the fuel consumption as modelled by the regression model at step 2.

4th. For the sake of curiosity, we plot the pairs plot, from the original dataset, removing the variables not used in the model.

User Input Values
=================
The user is supposed to input the following values:
a. number of cylinders of his/her car
b. the car weight (in lbs)
c. the number of gears
d. the HP information
e. whether the car has a manual or a automatic transmission

Outputed Value
==============
The predicted fuel consumption in miles per gallon.
